There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Apple dataset from 2016 to 2022 to better understand:

1. Which is the best time to Buy a Stock in the Stock Market ?

2. Which is the best time to Sell a Stock in the Stock Market ?
